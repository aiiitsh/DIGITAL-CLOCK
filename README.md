# DIGITAL-CLOCK
Digital Clock using ATMEGA32 with light, temperature and humidity sensors
The Digital Clock project aims to develop a versatile and user-friendly timekeeping device with additional functionalities to enhance its usability and convenience. The clock incorporates a range of features such as temperature sensing, light control, a timer, an alarm, a stopwatch, leap year detection, and the potential for a calendar. 

The clock's primary function is to display the current time accurately. It utilizes a digital clock mechanism, which provides a clear and easy-to-read time format on a LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) screen. The LCD not only shows the time but also incorporates a temperature sensor that allows the clock to display the current temperature. This feature enables users to conveniently check the temperature in their surroundings while glancing at the clock.

To ensure optimal visibility, the clock incorporates a light sensor that measures the ambient light intensity. This information is used to automatically adjust the LCD screen's brightness, ensuring that the displayed information is clearly visible under various lighting conditions. This feature eliminates the need for manual adjustments and enhances user comfort.

In addition to displaying the time and temperature, the clock also includes a timer function. The timer can be set for specific durations and alerts the user with a buzzer when the countdown reaches zero. This feature proves useful for various applications such workouts, or reminders for specific tasks.

Furthermore, the clock includes an alarm feature that allows users to set alarms for specific times. 

To enhance the clock's utility further, the design includes leap year detection. The clock automatically identifies leap years and adjusts the calendar accordingly, ensuring that the displayed date remains accurate.

In summary, the Digital Clock project combines essential timekeeping functionalities with advanced features to offer users a versatile and practical timekeeping device. The clock incorporates a temperature sensor, light sensor, timer, alarm, and leap year detection.
